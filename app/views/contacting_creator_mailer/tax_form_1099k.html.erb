  <h2>Your 1099-K form for <%= @year %> is ready to download</h2>
  <p>The 1099-K is a purely informational form that summarizes the payments that were made to your account during <%= @year %> and is designed to help you report your taxes.</p>
  <p>Our payment processor, Stripe, files a copy electronically with the IRS.</p>
  <p>The sales deposited directly to your connected PayPal and Stripe accounts are not included in your 1099-K. You will receive separate 1099-K forms for those sales from PayPal and Stripe.</p>
